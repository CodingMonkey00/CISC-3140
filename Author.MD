My name is Muhammad Ahmad I am a computer science major at Brooklyn College. Computer science is something I've always had interest in since highschool  
but I never considered it to be a career untill I was stuck at home during quarantine and thought about having a remote job. I would like to become a software 
engineer and gain experience in the field and start my own indie game company.
